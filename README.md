How Your Asset Pipeline Works:

(TODO: describe the steps in your asset pipeline, from source files to tiles/backgrounds/whatever you upload to the PPU466.)

How To Play:
* Jump from one platform to the other and avoid falling into fire.
* Don't get caught by the killer trailing you, and don't bump into the spikes on the right.
* Press the space key to charge the jump strength, the longer the key is pressed, the higher and further you jump.
